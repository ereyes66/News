<p><b><h2>Jeffrey Epstein's brother Mark accuses Bill Barr of covering up pedophile's death and says Trump's AG was 'protecting someone'</h2></b></p>

<p>Jeffrey Epstein's brother slammed former Attorney General Bill Barr's handling of the pedophile's controversial death as he accused him of a 'cover up.'

    Mark Epstein, 69, a property developer, hit out at Barr for his infamous line that there was a 'perfect storm of screw-ups' that led to Epstein's apparent suicide in a Manhattan jail in August 2019. 
    
    'Yes, there were screw-ups, but that doesn't mean that my brother was, you know, committed suicide because of screw-ups,' he told NewsNation's Leland Vittert. 
    
    'Why? I mean, you'd have to ask Bill Barr. If he was covering this up, which it appears to be, who was he covering it up for? Who was Bill Barr protecting?' </p>
